Coursework for SuperHi JavaScript for Designers

In this repository, I've included the completed code for my SuperHi JavaScript for Designers online course.

There are six projects in total on the course, and the resulting projects should illustrate examples of parallax and animation.

Part of the reason for sharing this across is for personal reference, should I wish to create projects based on what I did on the course. I also may revisit some of these projects in the future to expand upon themâ€“for example, create another website page, or alter them to create something more personalised.
