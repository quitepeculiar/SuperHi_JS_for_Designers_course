# SuperHi JavaScript for Designers Course: Type Checker

Description from the website:

In this chapter, we make an interactive website that lets you play with text and typography live in the browser. We discuss how to work with form tags such as text inputs, sliders, checkboxes and select boxes in order to make different type settings customizable, such as the font, size, and colors.

This project can also be viewed on the [SuperHi Editor](https://editor.superhi.com/projects/115832).
