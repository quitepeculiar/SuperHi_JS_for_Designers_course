# SuperHi JavaScript for Designers Course: Jenna Buchholz

Description from the website:

In this chapter, we go in depth into scroll events and parallax by adding progress bars, waypoints and thresholds.

This project can also be viewed on the [SuperHi Editor](https://editor.superhi.com/projects/115866).

The images within this project are not my own, and were provided with the course material.
